# Weather-App One Pager
This app will be a weather app that receives user input to determine what location they would want to see the weather at.

Location information will be gathered through an input bar and that input should be able to tell users if the location is not found or suggest a list of closely named locations to see if that is what they are looking for.


The display of the weather will consist of a main container that has the weather, humidity, wind speed, actual feel, and chance of precipitation.  It should also indicate the searched location.  Perhaps, I will include a localStorage option to cache the last few locations searched and have them automatically pull up and shown for the user.  This can be stored in a library index style.
